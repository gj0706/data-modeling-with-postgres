# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. The purpose of this project is to create a database with a star schema, and built an ETL pipeline for the analysis. 

## Project Datasets
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

And below is an example of what a single song file looks like:

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

## Project Description
This project performed data modeling with Postgres and built an ETL pipeline using Python by the following steps:

1. Defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema as below:

![Fact and dimension tables for the star shema design](https://github.com/gj0706/data-modeling-with-postgres/blob/main/img/sparkify_erd.png)

`sql_queries.py` contains all the sql queries and will be imported by other files

`create_tables.py` drops and creates the tables

2. wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

`etl.ipynb` reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads the data into tables. This notebook contains detailed scripts on the ETL process for each of the tables.

`etl.py` built the ETL pipeline
